## Thesis


HSBC is one of the world largest bank with significant presence in Asia, Middle-East and Africa. In 2008 financial turmoil, the bank weathered the crisis with a relatively healhly balance sheet. While many of its near-bankrupt peers have recovered strongly in recent years, HSBC continues to be a stalwart. Maybe its risk adverse saved it from the crisis, so I shouldn't blame them for their performance.   Part of their underperformance comes from their ineptness in meeting regulatory requirments and in managing the bad risks under the hood.

Despite the negatives, the bank has a strong balance sheet, a presence in emerging markets, and a high dividend yield. The dividend seems quite safe at this point. Its low institutional ownership reflects the negative perception from the investment communities. 

I can see why institutions avoid the bank at this point, because it is like a mine field that can explode any time due to non-compliance. Its revenue growth is flat to declining,
and its business is not really producing anything exciting. Not a lot of coverage by investors/analyst, and just lots of negative press. 

The positive side is that the unglamorous stable business will still generate alot of income if you hold it as a dividend stock. It is producing mouth-watering yields which I prefer over bonds now. The organic growth in emerging market, and the future interest rate increase is both a positive for the company. But till then, investors will have to wait until regulatory risks are addressed. 


## Type of investment
Contrarion, boring stable business. 

## Catalyst
 Interest rate rise, emerging market performance, regulatory compliance, successful restructuring. 

## Recent Events
HSBC has recently received a lot of bad press concerning tax evasions, corruption, money laundering in its swiss unit. Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulators has been furvously probing HSBC on its banking practices. While the firm layed out plans for significant restructuring, it was moving too slow to stay in compliance. Every couple of months news comes out of governments levying fines on HSBC for its malpractices.



## Exit Strategy
* If non-compliance and regulatory costs continues to burden the company, its growth and balance sheet. Consider to exit the position. 
* If company continues to lag behind its peers, management continues to be asleep, and poor execution on restructuring, and emerging market business consider exit.
