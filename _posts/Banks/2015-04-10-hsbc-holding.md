## Thesis


HSBC is one of the world largest bank with significant presence in Asia, Middle-East and Africa. In 2008 financial crisis, the bank weathered the financial crisis with a relatively healhly balance sheet. However, since then,  it's financial performance is just a stalwart among its peers.  Notably, it's recent compliance and regulatory costs are a going concern, and negative bad press hurts the firm.

Despite the negatives, the bank has a strong balance sheet, a presence in emerging markets, and a high dividend yield. The dividend seems quite safe at this point. Its low institutional ownership, which can be seen as a positive or negative, perhaps due to lack of interest by the investment community presents a contrarion opportunity.

I can see why institutions avoid the bank at this point, because it is like a mine field that can explode any time due to non-compliance. Its revenue growth is flat to declining,
and its business is not really producing anything exciting. Not a lot of coverage by investors/analyst, and just lots of negative press. 

The positive side is that the unglamorous stable business will still generate alot of income if you hold it as a dividend stock. It is producing mouth-watering yields which I prefer over bonds now. The organic growth in emerging market, and the future interest rate increase is both a positive for the company. But till then, investors will have to wait until regulatory risks are addressed. 


## Type of investment
Contrarion, boring stable business. 

## Catalyst
 Interest rate rise, emerging market performance, regulatory compliance, successful restructuring. 

## Recent Events
HSBC has recently received a lot of bad press concerning tax evasions, corruption, money laundering in its swiss unit. Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulators has been furvously probing HSBC on its banking practices. While the firm layed out plans for significant restructuring, it was moving too slow to stay in compliance. Every couple of months news comes out of governments levying fines on HSBC for its malpractices.



## Exit Strategy
* If non-compliance and regulatory costs continues to burden the company, its growth and balance sheet. Consider to exit the position. 
* If company continues to lag behind its peers, management continues to be asleep, and poor execution on restructuring, and emerging market business consider exit.
