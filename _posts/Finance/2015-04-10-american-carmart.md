CRMT is one of the largest public held auto-retailers. It operates under the "Integrated Auto Sales and Finance" segment of the used car market.  Namely, half the business is run like a bank, and half the business is selling cars. Subprime lending risks should be considered.

## Qualitative
1. Market potential for the long run
    
    Moat: it targets low credit customers, matching financing to   their needs. Most car sellers donâ€™t touch financing, and is therefore unable to match the budget to the needs. Another advantage is that the company will be able to take the car when a default on loan occurs and resell the car.
    
    There will always be car buyers who require subprime loans. If you are a dealer specializing in helping low credit customers buying cars, it is a great niche to be in.  

2. Management determination to develop products and process for the long haul

    Management in training program develops the store managers necessary for expansion into future stores. There are determined to replicate the current model organically and conservatively. 

    A strong IT department and financing department: R&D is spent here. Technologies to improve operating efficiencies, recently an integration of phone lines into IT system, and a system to see car data. The design of financing rules are so integral to the business, money spent is right on the spot

3. R&D efforts relative to its size

    As noted earlier, R&D is strong and significant in the IT and financing. Carmarts has focused on centralizing certain functions, like purchasing, IT, credit evaluation which has cost synergies across its dealerships. 

4. Sales organization

   Subprime lending is all about account collection. Collection process seems to be reasonable, they are not too aggressive in hurting customers, and they monitor credit quality verify carefully. The delinquency rate is in the 20% range throughout the years. 
   
   There is a level of skill in aquiring low credit customers and making sure they don't default on their payments. Their sales organization is well trained to acquire customers that meet their profile. 

    Manager in Training develops the personnel necessary for a good car selling business. Company is very focused on HR. 

5. Profit Margin

    Company acquires cars in wholesale. Recently CRMT has improved it purchasing operations, by selecting higher quality used cars and lower costs on such purchases. The company has focused on the inventory cost and quality.

    Car-mart charges 15% interest on customer loans and does not adjust the rate based on competition. A steady profit margin is maintained throught the years. 

6. Improving profit margins?

    - Screening customers who are less likely to default
    - Focus on the quality and cost of inventory purchase
    - Better marketing campaigns <- a important focus of the business

7. Labor and personnel relations

    - Company respects and train employees. MIT program.
    - Cash bonus and stock options tied to performance. 
    - Glassdoor review shows employees greatly satisfied with crmt. Comments are constructively positive. Rating 4.5

8. Outstanding executive relations?

9.  Depth in managements

    Store managers are well trained and knowledgeable. Top executives have insight and control of the business

10. Growth

    Organic growth within a particular region in US. In the long term it may extend to a larger area. 
    
    Company is buying back shares for the past five years while continuing to expand stores using retained earnings. Company does not need to raise additional capital via debt or equity and it is using its revolving credit facility wisely for short term cash need in proportion to its sales. The reduction in shares is a plus, and I prefer it over dividends. In fact the company operates under very little cash, but that doesn't seem to make it more risky given a conservative loan loss reserve. The real risk that needs to be monitored is the delinquency and missed payments(credit quality) over the long haul.
