Puerto Rico's default risk has been impacting the economy as well as the banks operating on the island. FBP is one of the banks that has been restructured and will continue to restructure in face of the default risks facing Puerto Rico. The company has de-risked itself over the years, turned positive earnings and is well positioned to compete in the banking sector. 

Despite the islands default headlines recently, asset risks and loan performance has been managed conservatively. Growth may by limited in the short term, but with the banks undervaluation and recovery, the bank will return to its normal level of profitability in years to come.

- Sell on non-performing assets negatively impact earnings, but is positive for the company's asset in the long run. 
- Negative headlines in Puerto Rico's debt default impacts stock price. Management said loan activities at the micro level seems healthy and not what the headline risk shows. 
- Quarterly earning is reflecting the cost expenses of the Doral bank aquisition. The positive is that FBP is now the 2nd largest bank in Puerto Rico, and in much better competitive position.
