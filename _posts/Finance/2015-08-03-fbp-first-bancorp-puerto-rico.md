Puerto Rico's default risk has been impacting the economy as well as the banks operating there. FBP is one of the banks recovering from the bad loans during the decline in the island's economy. The company has de-risked itself over the years, has turned positive earnings and is well positioned to compete in the banking sector. 

Despite the islands recent default headlines, the bank has conservatively managed the asset risk portfolio. Growth may by limited in the short term, but with the bank's undervaluation and recovery, the bank will return to its normal level of profitability in years to come.
