Mistakes were made purchasing EROC and NRP. I overlooked macroeconomics, management and debt factors having material impact on the companies' operations. 

### EROC
EROC suffered from poor management more than anything else. During favorable energy environments, EROC was losing money while blaming it on weather factors. It also mismanaged its balance sheet, carrying on heavy debt load while not able to cover its distribution to unit holders. The stock tanked and everything went downward spiral from there.  EROC managed to offload assets to fix the balance sheet, but operational wise, it is still not doing a good job. The lesson from here is that solid management and  balance sheet cannot be overlooked despite a compelling growth story. Always follow the distribution coverage for MLP. 

### NRP
NRP owns energy reserves (a signficant amount is coal) which it rents out to mining companies in return for royalty payments. The business can maintain high margins because capital expenditure is carried out by the miners. What was overlooked was that coal was a declining business with significant government regulation. Despite coal being a viable energy way into the future, the recent regulation cause more negative impact on business than expected. The story is don't find the fed (or the government), despite what you think about the long term story of coal. Better own it when the dust settles. 

I think the business has a solid strategy going forward, but the uncertainty over coal can undermine any calculation of the company's valuation. It is not worth holding on given the uncertainty.  

### Conclusion
The lessons drawn here are don't overlook management, pay attention to balance sheet, specifically in MLP where most of the cash is distributed, don't underestimate macro trends and fight the government over long term prospects, e.g. coal regulation, oil prices.
