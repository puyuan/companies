## Thesis

BP was setback by the Deep Horizon oil spill back in 2009.  Following a brief period of dividend cut, BP reinstated its dividend, albeit a smaller amount prior to the disaster, to boost confidence in its stock. Entered a position in BP to wait for the turnaround while collecting a 4% dividend.

## Exit Strategy

Oil majors are divesting downstream businesses to strengthen high margin businesses. BP was following this route, but slowed down due to the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Looking forward to BP's faster business transformation while improving the necessary operational safety measures. Exit if there is long term undermanagement. 



## BPâ€™s company vision stated by CEO Bob Dudley:

My vision for BP is a focused oil and gas company that creates value by growing long-term sustainable free cash flow through safe and reliable operations, a disciplined and prudent financial framework, and a portfolio biased to high-margin opportunities.

## Updates

### 2015-07-31
Uncertainty surrounding the litigation has finally cleared up as BP's horizon oil spill finally reached settlement with the US government.  The bad news is low oil prices continue to persist, which may impact BPs dividend coverage and future investment potentials.
