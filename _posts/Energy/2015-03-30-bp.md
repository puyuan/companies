## Thesis

Setback by the 2009 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, BP’s stock price plummeted to a historical low valuation. From a brief period of dividend cut, BP reinstated its dividend, albeit a smaller amount prior to the disaster, to boost confidence in its stock. Entered a position in BP to wait for the turnaround while collecting a 4% dividend.

## Exit Strategy

Oil majors are divesting downstream businesses to strengthen high margin businesses. BP was following this route, but slowed down due to the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Look to BP for faster transformation of businesses, as well as changing its underlying management of safety and security. Exit if there is long term undermanagement. 



## BP’s company vision stated by CEO Bob Dudley:

My vision for BP is a focused oil and gas company that creates value by growing long-term sustainable free cash flow through safe and reliable operations, a disciplined and prudent financial framework, and a portfolio biased to high-margin opportunities.

## Updates

### 2015-07-31
 BP's horizon oil spill finally reached settlement with the US government. The uncertainty is removed in the company's valuation. Low oil prices continues to be a concern. BP promises to maintain the divident for 24 months if low oil prices persists.
