## Thesis
Shell's current selloff provides an opportunity for establishing an entry position. With strong balance sheet and focused restructuring efforts, Shell will be able to navigate the low oil prices. With a 6% yield, this is a sit and wait stock. 


## Risks
- Extend low oil prices will hurt the company if oil doesn't recover after 2 years. 
- If Shell's BG integration fail to show synergy, it may cost the company dearly. 

## Exit Strategy
- When dividend is cut, or balance sheet becomes over leveraged.
