PAH is a platform company focused on the specialty chemical area. They focus on low asset high touch businesses, namely, low capital expediture, high margins businesses and acquire than at reasonable value. Because the industry is highly fragmented, the company believes it has plenty of room for acquisitions.  

I see this as a cash rich business, with opportunities to grow by using cash flows, reasonable debt and equity offerings. The founding company macdermid has nearly a hundred year of history, so it is not experience-less, and the outsider chairman has rich experience with platform companies.
