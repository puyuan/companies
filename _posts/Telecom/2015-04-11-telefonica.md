### Company
In Europe, the Telefónica Group generated 23.9% of its total revenues in Spain, 14.0% in the United Kingdom and 11.0% in Germany in 2014.

In Latin America, Telefónica Hispanoamérica and Telefónica Brazil represented 26.1% and 22.3% of the Telefónica
Group’s revenues

### Thesis
Telefonica is the Spain’s largest telecom company with growth expansion in latin America. Market growth in Spain may have saturated, but growth in Latin America will continue as the emerging market grows. Telefonica is a leader in its business and has a wide moat.. Although it faces  some competition, Telefonica will continue to make money with the wide adoption of wireless communication. 

- Deeply undervalued. Recent public debt crises in Spain has depressed Telefonica’s stock price. Single digit p/e, and trading close to book value. 
- High debt load in volatile credit environment has changed the fundamental outlook of the company. The risk is worth the reward at current prices. Although there is a potential danger, TEF’s strong cash flow should sustain the balance sheet going forward. The probability of bankruptcy is low, but a drag on growth is concerning. 
- High dividend after dividend cut. Provides a cushion for further downsides. In the long term, TEF’s stock price will rebound. 

### Exit Strategy
- Telefonica is highly leveraged  even in industry standards. Going forward, continued debt reduction is a priority. 
- Spain’s econonmy continues to falter
- Cash flow cannot sustain business.
