Focus on single tenenant industrial properties in secondary markets. Returns are high because of added risk of single tenenat in secondary markets, where replacement tenants are harder to find. Most of their properties are warehouses, which are non-discretionary to most tenants. 

I like their conservative leverage, but would like to see more track record.
