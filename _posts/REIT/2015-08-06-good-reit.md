I originally heard the idea from Chris Swatta's value investing podcast. The stock has been paying steady income stream for the last 3 years with on average 8% yield. Recently, after reading some analysis online, I decided to do more due diligence with the companies financial statements.

It turns out the company is barely covering its dividend and the management had to forego some incentives to cover that. Part of being a REIT is to renew leases and secure new lease contracts. It turns out many of its properties are in remote areas, with very industry dependent building layouts that it is hard to find new tenants after the original tenant moved out.

I looked at 3 of its vacant properties and they took 2-3 years for them to find a new tenant while grossly paying bonuses to real estate brokers to find a tenant. Images of their properties showed that the buildings are remote, old, and not in very attractive locations. Its hard to imagine how these real estate can increase in price over time. 

## Type of Trade

 ## Post Mortem
 
 Negatives: 
 - high debt load
 - ffo barely covers dividend
 - low quality assets
 - hard to seek tenants
 - many properties seemed old, once tenant moves out, its hard to imagine how these properties will be leased out
