Realty Income seems like a solid commercial REIT with credit-worthy and diversified tenants. It is targeting commercial zones within attractive demographics area, and maintaining good relations with its tenants to solicit future deals. Basically it buys properties from tenenants and leases it back to them. 

I like their operating metrics, increasing affo per share and low leverage compared to peer group
